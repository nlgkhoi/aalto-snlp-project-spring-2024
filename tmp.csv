1,What i find funny is the loyalty and blindness of english community. The worst possible choice for them is liberal and yet they keep voting for them every time. They keep renewing hope every election 1 year prior to it  just to ignore them at the winning speach already. Honestly PQ have more respect for english community then liberal  at least they dont lie to you just to get your vote. That being said i dont vote PQ either tired of those old man but that is another story. I mostly vote local candidate regardless of party even voted liberal once.. Outch that was hard to admit. But seriously guy's drop the act anti PQ anti QS dont vote for CAQ cause they dont win etc.. Any of those will at least respect you when they say no. And most of time they will say yes and ACT on it not just saying it like liberals do.,0

6,This is just another attempt to shut down speech the Democrats don't agree with.  The effect it would have would be either to silence everyone in America or to tie up the courts for eternity in stupid pursuits.,1
7,Ugly American.....Trump's ugly presence and mean spiritedness has breathed new life into this term. so many otherwise rational  well balanced and good hearted Americans are embarrassed  too.,1
8,Yep. Go be cannon fodder due to being born poor. You are a piece of real sad humanity.,0
9,What we need to do is do away with provinces entirely.  They're just an anachronistic holdover from the 19th century when it took weeks for people  goods and communications to get from one to the other.,0
