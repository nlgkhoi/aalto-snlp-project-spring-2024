0,I get the odd feeling Klastri  the head of the ACLU of Hawaii  will step in and defend this scum for freedom of speech.,?
1,I couldn't disagree more with this column; Canadians have moved on and don't care how primarily the Progressive media and others label people. Why don't we stop putting labels on people.  Singh's biggest problem will be if he has to under the LEAP agenda. It really is that simple.,?
2,Does the property owner have a vote in the  tax increase?  And maybe it's time to scale back the parks  and a government worker retirement that comes with these parks.  If the neighborhood wants the park let them maintain it without government. If the neighborhood doesn't like the park let it go to waste.  There must be greener pastures outside of the state and the ponytail man,?
3,Shawn  do you think it may be due to the fact our "public servants" are not in that catagory now? Public servants  did not  expect full  better then our retirements  higher wages and associated  they did it for service at no pay expected. Now  they pad their pockets  think we are stupid and continue on. I do  for one  believe this next election cycle may  I hope  change it?,?
4,You proved she turned over 100% of the relevant emails... thats funny because the Washington Post proved that she didn't turn over relevant emails.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/22/the-fbi-found-15000-emails-hillary-clinton-didnt-turn-over-uh-oh/?utm_term=.3fa25fb76c6f  "the FBI found several thousand work-related emails that had not been previously turned over by Clinton."  And this by a Clinton ally.  You lost here you lost there and you are to dumb to get out of the game.  Let me say that again SLOWLY so you can understand it it... QUIT LYING and give it up already.  Its pathetic.,?
5,Looks like all teachers MUST be placed on the No-Fly list now. And teachers should not be allowed to buy guns either. Clearly  ALL teachers are lunatics that can't be trusted. We must remove all teachers from the classroom. We must make schools Teacher Free Zones.,?
6,Well  they haven't made it illegal to store rainwater. The tech is available  and even if you can't store it "drinkably safe" - it can still be used for things like watering the garden and doing the laundry (I know it can be stored/purified for safe drinking - just considering options should one be unable to afford the tech for that).,?
7,Why did we elect these fools to run the country? They can't even roll out marijuana legalization.  something any corner store could do.,?
8,Check your privilege.  Why do you automatically assume the women selected are less meritous than men (especially white men)?  Just because a bunch of white guys weren't chosen for every job in sight  you cry discrimination.  What a hypocrite.,?
