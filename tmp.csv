0,Except that Desmond played first base last night. Tapia was in LF  and Reynolds had a night off.,0
1,What i find funny is the loyalty and blindness of english community. The worst possible choice for them is liberal and yet they keep voting for them every time. They keep renewing hope every election 1 year prior to it  just to ignore them at the winning speach already. Honestly PQ have more respect for english community then liberal  at least they dont lie to you just to get your vote. That being said i dont vote PQ either tired of those old man but that is another story. I mostly vote local candidate regardless of party even voted liberal once.. Outch that was hard to admit. But seriously guy's drop the act anti PQ anti QS dont vote for CAQ cause they dont win etc.. Any of those will at least respect you when they say no. And most of time they will say yes and ACT on it not just saying it like liberals do.,0
2,Read the article  not just the headline & you will find out.,0
3,Speaking of a horses backside  is that where your head is at?,1
4,Michael Barone- gee are you dumb.  No other words needed.,1
5,too bad ignorant left wing sheep like you in the usa are suckered every day by the reality of LOSING!!!! it will be better business than the usa has seen in decades loser,1
6,This is just another attempt to shut down speech the Democrats don't agree with.  The effect it would have would be either to silence everyone in America or to tie up the courts for eternity in stupid pursuits.,1
7,Ugly American.....Trump's ugly presence and mean spiritedness has breathed new life into this term. so many otherwise rational  well balanced and good hearted Americans are embarrassed  too.,1
8,Yep. Go be cannon fodder due to being born poor. You are a piece of real sad humanity.,0
9,What we need to do is do away with provinces entirely.  They're just an anachronistic holdover from the 19th century when it took weeks for people  goods and communications to get from one to the other.,0
10,The leftists are all about racism. Look at the greatest leftists in history  like hitler  stalin and lenen.  The leftists are usually the biggest mass murders in history too!  Yea the left is anti-racist!,1
11,boots>  You are a miserable   crybaby   punkass prick.  Who do you think you can call a phony conservative.  You are such a phony  acting almighty poor loser jerk!  Why don't you stuff your head  up your butt  you might find some sense up there!  And furthermore  who gives a rip about Russia?  The only people concerned with the Russians are you liberal ass kissing dodos.  Maybe you might want to throw in the "heil Hitler"  bit also???  You people are so PHONY and psychotic.  Frickin' idiot.  Good night and good riddance    Burn in your own HELL!!!!  YSA!!!!,1
12,Chafee was one of the few Republicans to support strict gun control laws.,0
13,Give it a rest  Pat.  Liberal whores like you think you can tell the Catholic Church to pimp for your social justice garbage while ignoring the civil rights of a Church that is 97% white and middle class.,1
14,Hey Paulie  I'll go along with your idea to let the people vote on an income tax  if at the same time we get to vote on ending the $700 million a year tax credits for you pals in the oil industry?  Deal?,0
15,And I still haven't given up completely on CarGo.  He really is a special player when he's right.,0
16,one big group of crooks,1
17,He's primarily political.    What he chooses to do and not do is based on political calculus.  He salts his agenda and photo ops with just the right mix of talk about "openness" and "the evils of rigidity" with head nods to Our Lady  St Joseph  the Rosary  and even the Latin Mass  just not this week.  And even satan now and then.   Keeping things in balanced.  I bet there's a spreadsheet updated daily.,0
18,This season may become known for "The Curse of Tony Kornheiser".  I don't think Anderson's hamstring is as bad as the Rockies are making it out to be.  I think they have issues with his pitch selection  location and attitude.  Unfortunately  now that the Rox bullpen has fully taken on water  the whole ship is starting to sink.  I hope they get a win or two in San Francisco  because the Rockies are definitely NOT winning the division now.,0
19,Safety is the #1 reason self-driving cars will become the norm.,0
20,“He’s lived here for about three years ” Damien Pettit said. “He’s one of our neighbors. I’ve said hello in passing more than 50  60 occasions. He has two young kids. He was a very nice guy.”  Sure he was. Likely cursing you on more than 50  60 occasions.,0
21,John Fox saying" the other guys get paid too" is right on . The Giants made some good trap blocks to spring runs  of 47  16 and 14 yards. In addition  the Bronco linebacker hit the wrong gap on these runs. Otherwise  the Giants gained 71 yards on 29 carries for 2.4 ypc. Eli passed for only 128 yards and the defense only gave up 13 points. They have not regressed. Their margin for error is razor thin because of an inept offense. It would also be nice if the kicker would get over his slump.,0
22,What an idiot Tuck is!  "Just get an income tax on the books" - a casual confiscation of the income of hard-working Alaskans.  NO WAY,1
23,You_want_certainty._You_can't_handle_the_truth.,0
24,Yes its beyond pathetic  most of the media in this country are desperate lefties who appear to be angling  for a job on the CBC. Trump gave us Key Stone  a thank you would suffice !!!,1
25,Junior seems to be taking his cue from Kathleen Wynne.  Two incredulously incompetent politicians.,1
26,Is there a remedy for stupid? Judging by the willfully blind ignorance and jingoistic hatred displayed by many of the comments  including a number which look to originate from robots  it looks to be something like "viva la revolution"  something which is not likely to end well for any of us.,1
27,People are so worried about purported Russian influence on Trump. They should be far  far  far more worried about China's influence on Trudeau. The Globe us letting us down on that in a big way. And is it true that Chrystia Freeland's father is a canola farmer?,0
28,His family reported him missing on August 11th.  Obviously they think he is overdue.  How many days would you wait if someone in your family didn't come back when anticipated?,0
29,Lol. But you'll vote for the wife of a rapist/sex fiend.,1
30,When you come from a totalitarian society that is very tribal and that tribalism is expressed through the glue of religion   a free secular society like that in the West is viewed quite differently.  That is especially so when the prescripts of that religion deny many of the basic human rights that we in the West take for granted.  Hence we are subject to these incomprehensible terrorist attacks both thru new immigrants from those cultures  and from homegrown terrorists who romantizes  the whiff of 7th century cultures.  Yet here in the West  we are being brainwashed by those who profess the benefits of open borders ( but not open societies ) by allowing these alien cultures to profusely populate our lands.  Its insidious and subversive and is now  accompanied by suppression of free speech  as we are now seeing thrown at us by the MSM and their bosses in the wealthy 1 %.  it must be countered and snuffed out. Else our basic human rights will be eroded from within,0
31,People died in Benghazi.  The people at the embassy stated they asked for help on several occasions and were denied.  There was actual evidence to open an investigation.  The Russian investigation is based off nothing.  Please list the evidence you have since you're so adamant about it.,0
32,Blaming "elites" is clearly wrong headed. Trump did it and now with his temperament he is the top "elite" and could  start  a nuclear war  a war with China  trade wars. Trump's crazy thinking as the"elite" is based on "Make America Great ". "No longer trust our media" you are an idiot  I am quite certain that you have not read a newspaper in your life.,1
33,If you think the presence of a "treatment center" means anything  you have never been around anyone caught in the web of heroin.  Also suboxone is often diverted and resold on the street.  Not very likely someone shooting dope in plain view in an Ace bathroom is participating in a recovery program.,0
34,Hahahahahahaha!!! Now we're getting a lecture about civil conversation from the unnamed person from Chugiak? Isn't this the same individual recently restricted from civil comments because of a lack of civil comments? Hahahahahahahaha!!!,0
35,Our Senate... the chamber of sober second thoughts....  Our Senators should be distinguished... respected.. wise... refined...  Instead  this 47-year-old Senator has sex with a teenager  and it looks like his fellow senators are pretty much OK with that.... no real harm... she was of legal age... who wouldn't have sex with a cute little sixteen-year-old given the opportunity? Our Senate is an embarrassment....   shameful... a disgraceful group of leeches...,1
36,Thank you J. Frank. I think they may be saying that they admire that he is a strong leader  stronger than Obama  but I hear no praise for the system Putin is representative of.,0
37,The only train wreck of consequence   lost the  American election ignominiously  on November 8  2016.  The caboose on that train carried  the likes of  Globe editorialists who are now swooning hysterically because the Trump administration is beginning to carry out its clearly outlined agenda.,0
38,Global warming enriches the elites.,0
39,Just how is this story enhanced by taking pot shots at Gaga? It's not  of course. It's lessened  and that's a damn shame.,1
40,I've just spent about 15 minutes laughing out loud after reading these gems  now forever known as trudeaueulogies:  https://twitter.com/hashtag/trudeaueulogies  "We mourn the death of Vlad the Impaler  who spearheaded initiatives which touched the hearts of millions."  "As we mourn Emperor Caligula  let us always remember his steadfast devotion to Senate reform."  "Bin Laden was charismatic leader who helped revolutionize airport security in his lifetime."  "OSU student Abdul Razak Ali Artan will be forever remembered for his love of automobiles and kitchen cutlery",0
41,All we need now is Craig Medred to chime in to complete the ADN/McCandless/Angry Condescending Alaskan trifecta.,0
42,Yes  by all means let's go bankrupt doing it. I'm sure the world will appreciate it.  We have so much Aloha.  Kind of stupid but lots and lots of Aloha.,1

45,Trumps is picking a legal fight with the supreme court  much like Harper did.   ... He must be getting desperate for a win.,0
46,Uhhhhh  by law property tax information is a matter of public record. Can't be kept hidden  out of public view.  Go to the state's website below and you can find anyone's property tax via their address.  http://qpublic9.qpublic.net/hi_hawaii_search.php,0

56,Can't turn it on  because it would probably knockout all microwave and wifi transmissions.   Think of it like an EMP blast of sorts.  Probably better to put it near Midway.,0
57,Falsely accuse the president of collusion?  Your head is obviously buried very deep.  The Donald is crooked as hell and is going down.  Hell the Donald might be gone by thanksgiving.    Some day you realize that Hillary is gone and the true damage being done is by republicans who always blow up the deficit while reducing anything good government does.  A pity that republicans are no longer like Eisenhower.  Our national security has been compromised by having a moron in charge.  A moron who makes GW look smart.  Now that is  an accomplishment.,1
58,I'm very proud I voted for President Trump.  You can't fix stupid  anyone who thinks illegals are a benefit to America is a clueless delusional idiot.,1
59,Still not cost effective... 200k to save 32 K  I changed out the bulbs in my hose... Cost  was 35 bucks a bulb vs a regular 100W $2.50 bulb ...    I will never live long enough to see any savings in my electric bill.. I can't measure the saving because it is so small at the residential house hold level ...   In reality the actual LED light and fixture  plus labor for 3 workers  (at $150/hour two changing the bulb + flagging traffic?) and equipment costs really run the cost up.  Est cost of 1 LED light and fixture $100 each  2 hours labor $300 Equipment cost $20 dollars  per change out.  I will bet the total cost is close to $400+ for everything  That is why the Mayor is talking about millions.,0
60,Of course  Ms. Freeland does not have a Nazi past; that was her grandfather's.  (Canada; the mouse that roared!),0

67,"I disagree with is the assumption that the proposed rule is based merely on evidence-free wishful thinking by ignorant government do-gooders."  - how many cases will glove wearing prevent? And by "prevent " I mean take care of the problem of norovirus  itself?  If the answer is anywhere close to "I don't know  but let's implement it  anyway " then you don't have much with which to disagree. . The analysis from the food safety publication that you provided is a great example: they  too  would no doubt champion proper hand-washing techniques  as that would solve the entire issue you describe in its citation.,0
68,Andy knocked it out of the Park with his last line  he nailed the Prince.,0

74,Shut up nerd. You try too hard.,1
75,Why not set aside a special "Panhandlers Park" as the only place where to ply their trade?  The city would require them to buy a license and wear it around their neck for viewing.  The fee's would go to provide porta potties on site and policing.  The public could wander through and donate to the panhandler of their choice.  It could become a major tourist attraction.,0
76,Suddenly Sabbath found themselves both unsure of their musical direction and labeled as has-beens.,0
77,Thanks for the link.  I have downloaded it and will use it to organize a group.  It goes without saying that I will communicate with representatives from both parties.,0
78,He is morose and sullen  and  like Dostoyevsky  suffers from epilepsy.,0
79,“...they’re using airspace available to all of us to make money.”  This has to be one of the most moronic statements possible. Yes  the airspace is available to all of us. All of us who are willing to invest hundreds of millions of dollars and assume the financial risk are free to start our own airline. Deregulation lowered ticket prices dramatically.  If you think air travel is expensive now  or that airline companies are unpleasant to do business with  just imagine how "affordable" and "friendly" they would be if micromanaged by government bureaucrats.,0
80,are you serious?  they are renter receiving home care services?  wow  this is worse than Conway in spinning the facts.  first and foremost is the need to protect the patients in such care homes; if not regulated  many can suffer unnecessarily and care would be substandard.  we have seen such scenarios with legal care homes  so what makes you believe this would not happen with unregulated care homes  while you claim you are smart but really what you are saying is really stupid.,1
81,you notion of trump is based on ignorance and hate and stupidity.. china IS a terrible country  no freedom  executions for stupid things  no free speech etc  wake up idiot,1
82,"This elementary entry level grade is simply embarasing."  Bwa ha ha!  In the same sentence an elementary grade level spelling error   while complaining about entry level elementary thinking!  Having these comments to read is delightful!!!,0
83,Megalomaniac + Pathological liar.  The world has seen enough of these insane despots bringing death  destruction  and financial ruin to humanity.  All aided and abetted by financial manipulators working the system they created for maximum personal wealth without ever getting their own hands dirty.  This is the best and brightest offered by the Republican Party?  The Party is imploding from the same ideological insanity as their proffered candidate(s).,1

86,"Bisexual."  That is how homosexualists use labels to divert the discussion away from the issue.       Call it what you want  but engaging in homosexual acts - or any kind of behavior - is the issue and the sin.  Again  there weren't more "gay" or "bisexual" men in Ancient Greece's pederast culture: they all learned how to engage in same-sex acts.,1

88,Economics 101 makes the same point; increases in the income (wage raises  income tax reduction or subsidies) at the lower pay scale goes straight back into the economy that is people will spend it.,0
89,It is obvious you did not read what I actually wrote and instead chose to construct a straw man from your own imagination to punt at.  Where exactly and in what exact words did the Holy Father say “quite clearly and unambiguously  that there are cases where it is perfectly proper for the divorced and remarried to receive the Eucharist”?  The question of personal impact is impertinent and a red herring.  I am not facing capital punishment  but I maintain an interest in that topic. I am not planning on procuring an abortion  but I maintain an interest in that topic.,0
90,I deprecate the facile use of the term "fascism".  It shows a complete lack of any understanding of the context surrounding the rise of fascism in the 20th century.,0

94,I subscribe to the Wall Street Journal and note that it does not allow anonymous comments.  I also note the comments section seems to be more civil than most and wonder if the lack of anonymity and writing something with one's name on it may reduce the ad hominem attacks.  Has there been any thought given to removing the anonymous feature completely?,0
95,Interesting that the potential savior of the Democratic party will not run as a Democrat for the Senate in 2018.  "Despite a push by some Democrats that he fully commit to the party  Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont confirmed Sunday night that he will remain an Independent as he seeks re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2018.",0

99,Putin will invite Trump and Bibi to Crimea (Yalta) to divide the world. Just like they did in February 1945. King wasnt invited because he was anti-communist and many believed anti-semite. This time Justin will be invited for the entertainment value. During the evening time he can sing and dance along the Black Sea shores. Justin will extol the virtues of diversity and having a good hairdresser to prevent split ends.,0

105,"Honest to God  what if I don't know?"  If you don't know by now  Lisa  then either you're as big of a liar as Clinton and Trump  or you're stupid beyond belief.,1
106,What we have with Trump is a demonstrated lifetime of sleazy nasty sexist  self absorbed behavior. Trump is clearly absorbed with sexual conquest  wanted by his victims or not. He does not care. The Clintons are saints compared to this man While Bill has his sexual issues  Hillary is the candidate and she has stuck by her man  deserving or not. That used to be considered a virtue among Christians  you know marriage as a lifetime commitment. Apparently at least with some evangelicals  marriage is now a one way street with the man calmly all the shots  rotten nasty behavior or not. It is like a time zone  back to when women were considered property by rich powerful men.,1
107,It's exactly the same as a gift card (except much harder to use up). Companies should have no right to eliminate the points without offering compensation that can be reasonably used.   I tried to book seven different flights in during the last 6 weeks to use up AM points. Could not do any of them  despite a huge amount of flexibility from me. I shouldn't have had to be in a panic to use the points  but if obligated to use them or lose them  I should be able to reasonably use them!,0

115,Everybody  regardless of party affiliation  should be behind the move to make Congress and those on capital hill subject to the same health insurance as the citizens. The fact that they are afforded such special privileges places them above the average citizen and distances them from reality.,0
116,Silly position. Clearly you don't understand the Sacraments.   You believe in a form of Donatism:  the spiritual standing of a priest determines the efficacy of grace received from the Sacrament.   A heresy.   The Sacraments are there to help you come closer to God  "thinning" one's pride  one's vanity  one's love of comfort  increasing the intimacy with Jesus Christ.  Reconsider  and don't let pride push you around.,0
117,Remarkable. Blaming Trump takes some doing but here you are.  I would also like to point out that Trump was the fawnee rather than the fawner but your narrative won't allow that. Sad.,0
118,"we're talking about our friends ... family ... neighbors "  Those are the key words  what should guide us  motivate us.  China solved its opium problem at one time  by executing all of the dealers  and all of the addicts.  Execution is still their method of choice  for many crimes  even political dissent.  But I suspect that heavy hands make for heavy hearts.,0
119,"The Liberal MP from Newfoundland and Labrador was appointed to the position in August." I know that it's only November 3  2017 but has Seamus done anything for the veterans to date? Does he have any thoughts about how our veterans should be treated. You must remember that Seamus accompanied Trudeau to the Khan Island for Xmas. I suspect that this appointment in August was not based on anything else except friendship.,0
120,Well by all means! Let's get this one on the books as paid a well! (It's almost every 5 days worked a state employee gets one day off..) The state non employees will pick it up! This is a sad but very real headline. And why the state is broke. Pure Foolishness.,1

125,At this point in history  there is no scientific evidence that any gods exist. Logic also says that claims made without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.     Sadly  some people don't ask for proof of these "god's punishment" claims but accept them because someone managed to get themselves called reverend.,0
126,You don't seem to 'get" the fact that Khadr was not represented in that court (he was incarcerated) and his lawyers were not informed. Do you really think she has a case?,0
127,How about let adults take their kids to the mall and spend some time with them and enjoy the spirit of Christmas instead of being accosted with a straight out of central casting cook from Alaska. Can't wait for the next ADN article talking about how he got his ass kicked outside of the Gaslight Bar "preaching" at 3 a.m.,1
128,Good article  but few read the RG.  For enforcement folks  we see that there is a wide degree of latitude in how officers apply the law. Only 17 tickets issued so far indicates to me that of the total infractions  it's a drop in the bucket. And then there are judges  some of whom will reduce the fine for first offense or mitigating circumstances. What would an officer do if someone later injured or killed someone while texting?  I am inclined to issue more tickets and let the judge make the call. For anyone caught lying about it  that is an immediate ticket. These people know. I sent a text to a friend that returned an automated text saying that she was driving and would reply later. That is a great app. Guessing  I'd say half the drivers think it is OK to text at a light. You can see many furtively texting  and some are the ones in front of you that seem to not notice the light. I'd add a few signs at street lights that read: "Distracted driving laws apply while stopped at light.",0
129,We  the American People are never going to get a re-traction or apology about this uneducated rant from the new "Teflon Don" (notice the quotes in case I need to change my terminology later on down the line  aka "wire tapping" is really not about W-I-R-E  T-A-P-P-I-N-G).  Nothing sticks to this guy because he will come out with another wild tweet or say something more outrageous  in the next few days and everyone will forget about this issue.  So sad.  Make America look stupid and foolish again!,1

132,So what happens when the funds are cut off?  The federal funds go to Hawaii but nothing is said about where it goes to so who knows if the funds are going to where it is needed  where the pacific migrants are using social services.,0
133,There is no disputing that Donald Trump will be president. I'm not saying otherwise. But please quit trying to pretend that if we didn't have the Electoral College  you would be disenfranchised  and your vote wouldn't count. That's nonsense  and you know it. You can't defend what you wrote earlier. That's why you now have to fall back on "What part of "President of The United States" do you find so challenging " instead of making an intelligent argument.,0

144,And the shoot goes on  unabated.  Seems to be happening with increasing frequency  too.  Accept it as normal in America.  "They" are not about to let us do a thing about it.  Sad that so-many lives have to be lost and families torn apart  though.,0
145,Very sad statement on human nature  the comments by others across various segments in society.  Appears there are always more corrupt than good people at the top.  Even if these characters face their judgment day  they will still wreak havoc on the organization   honest subordinates  and their careers.  Been there and experienced that in the health field  which like many are sometimes the opposite for what they are supposed to morally stand for.,0
146,"Virtually no chance of a spill since the pipeline is buried 100ft below the riverbed.." The same way there was no chance of a spill at Exxon's Silvertip pipeline which was also buried 100ft below a riverbed (Yellowstone River)? Boy  sometimes that zero chance of a spill can make a mighty mess indeed (2011-63 000 gallons of oil into the river).,0
147,Well  at least he can see his dad more after he is convicted . . .  Piece of garbage . . .,1
148,Correct.  But neither are as bad as they were and racism is NOT the new normal and I hope you have the integrity to admit that.,0
149,Ronin006: After the Trump campaign paid his firm $50 000  Futerfas  a criminal defense attorney best known for representing four of New York's organized crime families  announced that he was representing Fredo. Would paying $50 000 to Futerfas be a legitimate legal expense for the campaign if it's not related to Fredo's Russian meeting? Or are you suggesting that Fredo has other  campaign-related legal troubles that we don't know about yet?,0
150,There is nothing in my comment which attempts to "disprove" Bennett's claim of mistreatment by Las Vegas cops.  In Bennett's initial public statement (not quoted in this article)  he brought up all those anecdotal situations as if they were the same as his.  I simply pointed out I'm not sympathetic to his attempt to tie those together with his situation.,0
151,There appears to be about 30-40% of trumps' voters who are racist fools.  That swung the election for trump.  (I am sure that you did not notice that! *eye roll*),1
152,Anyone know why Bundy senior wasn't arrested in Nevada? I know he and his sons held off the feds at his ranch there  but was he freely coming and going from there? At any rate  another not-so-smart move by the group.,0
153,I'm blessed by your metaphors  and thus by you!  Many thanks,0
154,The dumb one? At Fox? The intellectual equivalent of Dante's Seventh Circle of the Inferno. Not quite the bottom  but close enough for government work.,1
155,That doesn't make any sense. It was Hazelwood  first of all. and He wasn't the captain of this ship. Kind of a knucklehead comment if you ask me. Sounds like you want to drag a man's name through the mud years after a mistake was made. Why don't you go for a walk instead of saying things that are so dumb? :),1
156,If you want to restore to name calling  call me anything you'd like; I'm starting to enjoy how foolish you sound.  :-D,1
157,Come on Phil  you posted the same damn thing in 2013  except you deleted "The NDP are 20 POINTS ahead in the POLSS!!! (sic)  Orange is fading  like wallpaper from the 1970s  and Green is greening. But in 72 hrs  the flag of Red  White & Blue will continue to fly over this province.  Splendor Sine Occasu !,1
158,It's definitely a new thing. I don't mind it myself...I find myself being more conscious of the difference between a "good comment" vs. a comment that "fails the civility test" & find myself rating comments "good" even if I disagree with them when they are civil & especially if they bring up points that I can think about. It makes me feel better about people I disagree with.  I just read an article which mentions Civil Comments & its rationale. The entire article is worth a read: the social impact of uncivil discourse is one thing  but there's also economic & world political implications (among others). I think we're likely to see tech companies roll a lot more products to encourage civility in social media in the coming years.  "Play nice! How the internet is trying to design out toxic behaviour" http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/22/play-nice-how-the-internet-is-trying-to-design-out-toxic-behaviour  Have a great night Tom  good talking with you.,0
159,He also had roles in "A Country Practice" and "The Flying Doctors".,0
160,Most of the states with the "lowest taxes" also have the lowest wages  the worst schools  and the highest unemployment rates.,0
161,May all these worthless fuckers drown.,1
162,m:  Lame is inferring guilt when there has not been a legal proceeding.  Contact between a private citizen with a foreign government is different than contact between a government official and a foreign government.  Even you should be able to understand that.  But in the end regardless of one's status the question is whether something was illegal or not.  PS:  Your saying he or anyone violated a law or code with no legal proof is what is truly lame.,0
163,You're ignorant of the facts. The other two commentators proved it.,1
164,Do you want to pack before we go out?,0
165,Freezing for sure-and by her logic Elsie is going to be voting for Trump too!,0
166,Here you go  WarDog0000000 - you might want to read the complete analysis instead of the first few paragraphs:  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-blames-russia-putin-wikileaks-rele/  To correct your falsehood:  The U.S. Intelligence Community is made up of 17 agencies  forming the basis of Clinton’s claim.  The 17 agencies are: Air Force Intelligence  Army Intelligence  Central Intelligence Agency  Coast Guard Intelligence  Defense Intelligence Agency  Energy Department  Homeland Security Department  State Department  Treasury Department  Drug Enforcement Administration  Federal Bureau of Investigation  Marine Corps Intelligence  National Geospatial Intelligence Agency  National Reconnaissance Office  National Security Agency  Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director,0
167,A single payer public option would provide price competition for private insurance.,0
168,Clinton is a crook. But she's OUR crook.,1
169,Typical Liberal spin and double-talk.  Jr. gets twice as many selfie and photo ops if they announce the spending of the same money twice  doesn't he?  When will the public wake up and recognise Trudeau for the lightweight incompetent he is?,1
170,We are not so stupid as to believe you that this has nothing to do with hunting practices although one could argue that predator control is not hunting. The agency rule that was overturned banned certain predator control practices - baiting brown bear  shooting bear from an airplane or same day airborne and killing wolves during denning season or bears with cubs and specified.   And these are federal lands -  National Wildlife Refuges that have different purposes than the state's purpose of "sustained yield".  The purposes for National Wildlife Refuges are established by Congress not the State of Alaska no matter how much you might wish it so.,0
171," In other words  she’s not suffering from dementia".  Just for the record I'm not voting for Trump or Hillary the Sociopathic Liar  but I do sincerely  hope Ginsburg doesn't have dementia. Because when Trump most likely does become President I want her to remember and keep her promise to move out of the USA.,1
172,I am backing the PM on this issue.  After all  no one worked harder for his money than he did. Accordingly  if he says he is standing up for the little guy who is the elitist Mr. Sheer to challenge this?  Thank you thank you  PM  for taking on the bad bad millionaires and billionaires on behalf of the ordinary Joe!,0
173,Your theory presumes that the Russians would be willing to admit that they hacked the DNC  thereby effectively admitting they attempted to influence the US election.  The Russians insist they were not involved.  Publishing the hacked data on a party network would make it pretty clear they WERE involved.  As for Wikileaks  transferring the data through a third party intermediary isn't exactly the most complex concept to grasp.  I'm not sure why you don't understand it.    Finally  just for the record  the fact that you fail to grasp something does not necessarily make it a fabrication.  Your understanding is not relevant to the accuracy of the news.,0
174,I live next to a meth head. One of the 'cleaner' variety. He likes to do yard work at all hours of the day. He cut down all the trees on his property  put all the rocks into a neat pile  bangs on things all day and all night long  plays annoying loud tweaker music (DUM DUM DUM DUM DUM DUM DUM) all day and all night  has his tweaker friends over shouting incoherently at each other all night - specially during welfare payment week.  I wonder if he would be interested in trying some of this new stuff?,0
175,Well done. I see hints of what we were half a century ago when Lester pearson showed us that Canada could make a difference in other lives.,0
176,You know nothing about the legislative process but talk about holes? Learn to resist. Bad as talking about NFL players taking a knee.,0
177,It is remarkable how stupid Jared is. http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2017/05/hey-harvard-doesnt-just-sell-degrees-anyone I mean  like  stupider than Trump stupid.,1
178,You don't have a "right" to any of the free stuff you get in life  but I don't see you giving any of that up.,0
179,Not moving off of the tracks is really dumb. Just like moose  with their tiny little brains not much larger than a walnut. So sad that so many are so stupid. I agree that the train should speed up. Let the bottom of the oil pan of the locomotive be their scenic view. People that stupid only endanger the rest of us.,1
180,LOL you have no idea how wrong you are but go ahead - what percentage all IT jobs are in COBOL? Oh and you'll need a cite for that.,0
181,In June  the workers agreed to return to work with few gains.,0
182,Re: "Or maybe that ban isn't a Muslim ban"  Sorry  but: "Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States".  The only thing I hate more than WILLFUL ignorance is lying to cover it up.,1
183,Roy your defending lying to ethics   you saying bribery not a problem.. this whole rail is falling apart because our foundation starts with honesty. Rail is falling because of pay to play..,0
184,It looks like a Trump supporter is feeling blue that his hero is being revealed to be an incompetent buffoon.  Does anyone have any tissue for our dear little Bobbykins?,1
185,Bayley thought that sex was inescapably ridiculous.,1
186,Council still playing the extortion card. Don't forget these people  folks!  Question is: DO WE HOLD THESE SHYSTERS ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR PROMISES??? No property taxes. On time. On budget????  I'll remember "my" council member come election time and vote for whoever is running against him (IF anyone runs against  knowing this town).,0
187,What a headline!!!  Label him a "Veteran" but leave out affiliations to BLM and the DNC!  What crock!,1
188,Very good column. The NYT didn't so much approve of Trump's action as not denounce it apoplectically  as it usually does with respect to Trump  which  amounts to a kind of grudging approval in today's hyper partisan American political forum. It raised two issues about the legality of  Trump's action and urged Trump to seek to make his actions legal in the future.  One was the lack of congressional approval in accord with the constitution----sounding like Republicans a few years ago----while noting briefly that their own guy (Obama) didn't much bother with this. The other was the lack of UN Security Council approval  without mentioning that this was  impossible thanks to the Security Council veto and the Putin/Xi  doctrine that dictators who are clients of Security Council members should be free to do what they want to their own people without international interference  apart perhaps from a little hacking.,0
189,"The unduly and unscientifically alarmist CSSR cannot be put back into its political bottle. But it is the perfect vehicle for critical analysis and robust criticism  precisely because of its radical alarmist nature. Most importantly  this criticism would be official  which will make climate skepticism official U.S. policy.  Mind you  the CSSR is over 600 pages long  so its rebuttal would not be a trivial exercise."  https://townhall.com/columnists/davidwojick/2017/10/19/trying-to-perpetuate-alarmist-climate-science-n2396947?utm_source=thdaily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=,0
190,Though the accompaniments were kept very much under  they were still occasionally too loud.,0
191,Every monad arises from some adjunction  in fact typically from many adjunctions.,0
192,It's a big big deal for us. Caldwell is selling the office of the Mayor  destroying basic democratic values like free speech and civil rights  undermining the Ethics Commission  plundering the city treasury  turning our parks and public projects into "PAY TO PLAY" schemes to name a few.  Also  Kirk Caldwell is continuing Mufi Hannemann's legacy at City Hall. Caldwell has not met a massive development he does not like.  Caldwell is causing irreparable damage to "Keep The Country Country" region. We cannot allow him to continue the path of destruction.,0
193,Actually they were arrested by the Canadians,0
194,Go away  Troll. Ugh.,1
195,The vast majority of the budget goes to salaries. You have a whole district of senior teachers who have been getting step raises for decades with many making close to 100k a year. Of course seniority is the only qualification for retention and promotion. How could such a nepotistic  incompetent system produce anything but the current failure we are experiencing?   Not to mention the bloated administration staffs. Education could be done so much better for so much less  so quit asking for more of other people's money to throw down the bottomless hole  and lets get to the heart of the issue. The teacher's public-employee union has ruined the schools. Trade unions are good; public employee unions like the teachers' and SEIU are a joke.,0
196,I have no doubt what so ever PET's not-with-standing could be used here  but keep in mind The Canadian Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms is not Canadian Law  as Quebec never signed on to it.,0
197,Just like guys who wear surfer shorts right!?! Cover it up gents lol! Who wants to see beauty in living color? oh no surfers make sense but don't you think us woman should grab them by their jewels cause they have beef cake chests? What about the football pants  shootfire  guess us women should say they deserve to be mocked by the savage.  The ballet is senseless to discuss with the likes of you people because you lack the intellect to understand beauty doesn't always mean sexual!!!!!!!!!,0
