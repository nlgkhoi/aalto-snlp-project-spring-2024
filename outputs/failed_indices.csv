825,"There are serious potential causes behind Trump's behaviour - here's just one.   Trump has taken Propecia (finasteride) - to help prevent male pattern baldness - for many years  according to a report released by his doctor. The side effects of this drug are legion  and serious. The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects  (shrinking penis  poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition  mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a ""disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function "" and changes in mental abilities  sleeping patterns  and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?  Trump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

892,Science has shown cancer has a solid link to fructose. It’s the one thing our body doesn’t really need. It gets metabolized in our liver and coats it in fat.  When fructose is fed to cancer cells  it causes them to divide and multiply rapidly. Fructose is in nearly every damn food you can pull off the shelf  and it’s usually in the form of high fructose corn syrup.  Next time you're in a store  look at a label. Look under carbs to see if it has sugar in it. If it does  it’s high fructose corn syrup  and nearly everything food out there has it.  That is the culprit  and the only way you’ll avoid it is by sticking to a diet in red meat  chicken  fish  veggies  nuts and seeds  with fruit sparingly. Which is basically what our ancestors did.  There is a reason why Japan is so low on the list in cancer yet have long lives; their traditional diets are basically absent of fructose.,0,1

I also found plenty of things to get involved in because Fairbanks residents have to create their own good times. People here are doers. When you meet someone questions don't revolve around jobs  we ask where have you hiked/biked/hunted/fished/climbed/etc. In other words  how have you taken advantage of this place and what it offers?

As Michelangelo Signorile has noted  Trump's entire cabinet is a veritable Who's Who of homophobes with proven track records of being virulently anti-gay. Somehow  the media never cover that. It bears asking: why not? As for Neil Gorsuch and how he might shape the Supreme Court on LGTB issues  that remains shrouded in mystery which only time will tell.

Having said that  I did have an experience with a border control official at Pearson Intl who demanded a proof of live birth certificate (basically long form birth certificate) because my wife kept her last name and so didn't match our kids' last names. We eventually convinced him she was their birth mother and allowed to travel with them by having our kids (ages 7 and 5 at the time) attest to her being their mommy. So you may be right in the sense that this could very well be the one idiot at the border who needs a refresher. We'll see soon enough whether this becomes widespread or not.  In our case  every time we go to the US  we bring a notarized letter stating that my wife is our kids' mom. Haven't had a problem since (knock wood).,0,1

So  support a document that was developed via two synods and hundreds of dioceses. Two  to count and use numbers to gauge significance or importance is the work of a small mind Three  the dubia folks do not even start with AL - read their posted dubia - never even quotes from AL....they do not dialogue; they judge based upon their own misunderstandings...so  how can one dialogue when dubia are made up based upon a willful disregard and rejection of a papal document.

And the media takes a keener interest in politics than it does music or pro-wrestling. Trump is a freak or a sport.

8892,I was a forest fire fighter in Canada for 7 seasons. Some men were great to work with  and some--far too many--were purveyors of sexism and harassment. Many more were silently complicit.  Reading this article brought a host of memories flooding back that I'd really rather never relive  like listening to my crew boss and his side-kick laughing their asses off about hate-fucking women   then upping the ante with a story of getting a girl so drunk she  passed out in the bathroom stall the guy pulled her into and continued to have sex with  eg  raping her  in the process concussing her head against the steel wall of the stall and sending her to hospital.  Let that sink in. This was just lunch time hysterically funny banter in their world.

Demanding celibacy of young men who proved  again and again  that suppression of sexual energy leads to violating those vulnerable to their predation.  As in most crimes  the cover-up is a more serious crime  because it's a more conscious and methodical use of will power to subvert the truth.

9162,The reason most people don't care about Trump's ties are because most Democrats didn't seem to care when it was PROVED that the Clinton camp and the DNC rigged a primary election. That's way worse than Russia spreading fake data on Facebook. No Dems  including Clinton  will take responsibility for rigging the election process  but we're supposed to be outraged about fake FB stories? Clinton was an unlikable  proven criminal with a enough skeletons to fill an airplane hanger. That's why she lost. (Before you start with the name-calling  I didn't vote for Trump.

9184,I'll bet that a fair number did do exactly that  give the middle finger to the establishment and it's supporters  but when you believe that you have nothing to lose...crumbs from Obama's table just wasn't enough for those voters.

Then there's Obamacare... and still other reasons that make sense to those voters if not to you. Trump may be lying thru his teeth on his promises  time will tell  but at least he gave them the time of day unlike Hillary who simply labeled them and wrote them off.

9590,There's a difference between confidence and overagressiveness brought on by insecurity. Trump is a childish authoritarian with a fragile ego. He goes a wee bit irrational over things like his alleged small hands and the sparse attendance at his inauguration.  His unhinged tweets are how he releases his tension and insecurity.   How much do you think it bothers him that Melania pushed his hand away?  Answer:  a lot.  He prides himself on dating and marrying only 10's  and on being in control of the situation.

Barry's stubborn unwillingness  to name Islam as motivation for world wide terror is but one example.  His empty ""Red Line"" threat was an invitation to bad guys everywhere. Barry's brain trust (Susan Rice and John Kerry) assured us that the Syrians had gotten rid of chemical weapons.  Well  we know that was one of many lies.

I claim my mortgage interest  my property taxes  the reduced taxability of my social security benefits   my elderly status  my marital status  my medical deductions and all of the other  tax  exemptions or credits which I am legally able to claim.    I expect others to do the same.    If you do not claim any of those things  that is your decision.    Claiming them does not make me evil and not claiming them does not anoint you as a saint.   The same applies to anyone else in the United States  even Trump.  In his businesses he just has many more opportunities than others.  Maybe he is smarter,0,1
